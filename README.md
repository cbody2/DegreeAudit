# Degree Audit
This is a console-based app that aims to help XULA students view their graduation requirements. Xavier University of Louisiana already had an application in their system that does a similar job, called DegreeWorks. Sometimes, DegreeWorks has trouble separating and identifying certain courses that count towards a particular credit, such as core/major/minor credits, for a student. In turn, a student may have increasingly more trouble with knowing how far they are on track to graduating. This app fixes those issues, by leveraging transcript data to accurately measure completed credits versus the required total credits based on the student's major. Additionally, it identified and highlighted the missing credits or courses needed for graduation.
